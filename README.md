# ML on Housing Data
In this repo, I work with different algorithms on housing prediction as a means to understand how to the different models function. The report is available as a pdf which is contains the data analyzed using various algorithms. It can be used as a means to clearly understand how the prediction algorithms behave. I've ended it with a plot of how the different algorithms performed.

This will be the base to my next project on webscraping and performing analysis on real time data.

# Data
The data was taken from UCI Hosing repository
